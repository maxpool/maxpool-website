Establishes that constant-depth transformers without CoT solve only AC⁰ problems, but with T CoT steps can compute any problem solvable by size-T circuits. Polynomial CoT achieves P/poly expressiveness—essentially any efficiently computable problem. Validated on four benchmark tasks (modular addition, permutation composition, iterated squaring, circuit value) showing CoT dramatically improves accuracy on inherently serial tasks. Key insight: CoT length should match problem's "serial depth"—explaining why step-by-step reasoning helps arithmetic and planning but not pattern matching.</td>

Reveals highly heterogeneous MAS performance (+81% improvement to -70% degradation) determined by task structure, not agent count. Introduces predictive mixed-effects model achieving R²=0.513 cross-validation accuracy and 87% optimal architecture prediction. Identifies critical ~45% baseline threshold where coordination value inverts, 17.2× error amplification in independent MAS vs 4.4× centralized, and 58-515% coordination overhead scaling. Provides principled guidance: use single-agent for sequential reasoning and high baseline tasks; centralized MAS for parallelizable numerical reasoning; avoid independent MAS universally.</td>

Key findings: 68% execute ≤10 steps before human intervention, 70% use off-the-shelf models without fine-tuning, 85% build custom implementations over frameworks, and 74% rely on human evaluation rather than benchmarks. Demonstrates that successful teams deliberately trade capability for controllability—using constrained architectures with predefined workflows (80%) rather than open-ended autonomy. Challenges research assumptions by showing prompting beats tuning, custom code beats frameworks, and reliability engineering beats capability scaling.</td>

Implements "fully autonomous minimal information paradigm" where agents independently search, verify, and synthesize live market data without human assistance. Key finding: general intelligence does not translate to trading ability—most agents exhibited poor returns and inadequate risk management. Risk control capability determines cross-market robustness, while AI strategies achieve excess returns more readily in liquid markets than policy-driven environments.

Built on Microsoft AutoGen, agents engage in structured Round Robin debate when analyses diverge, producing consensus recommendations with transparent reasoning trails. Backtesting on 15 technology stocks (Feb-May 2024) showed multi-agent portfolios outperformed single-agent approaches in risk-neutral scenarios by balancing short-term signals with long-term fundamentals. Integrates explicit risk tolerance profiles through prompt engineering, enabling contextual investment decisions. Framework mirrors institutional investment committee reasoning, providing audit-ready discussion logs for regulatory compliance.

Tests state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Kimi-K2, Qwen3-235B, Claude-4-Sonnet) against buy-and-hold baseline. Critical finding: general intelligence does not translate to trading ability—GPT-5 ranked 9th of 12, barely matching passive strategy. Best performer Kimi-K2 achieved +1.9% return with -11.8% max drawdown vs baseline's +0.4% with -15.2% drawdown. Reveals dramatic market regime sensitivity: agents failed during downturns (Jan-Apr 2025) while succeeding in upturns (May-Aug 2025). Performance degrades with portfolio size increase.

AI-adjusted portfolios generated $17.1M quarterly alpha versus human managers' $2.8M—a ~600% improvement. Tested on 3,300 diversified U.S. equity funds using 170 public variables (Treasury rates, credit ratings, earnings call sentiment, firm size, trading volume). Counterintuitively, AI primarily relied on simple variables but deployed sophisticated machine learning to extract maximum predictive value. Modified ~50% of holdings quarterly while maintaining fund risk characteristics. Introduces "shadow price" concept—the hidden processing cost of extracting value from free data. Even allocating 42% to passive indices, AI still dramatically outperformed active managers. Complements StockBench and AI-Trader findings: AI excels as analyst (information processing) rather than direct trader (real-time decisions). Acknowledges limitations: "If every investor were using this tool, much of the advantage would go away."</td>

Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved $2,217.93 mean net worth (vs $500 starting capital), outperforming human baseline of $844.05, but exhibited extreme variance—worst runs ended in bankruptcy after "meltdown cascades" including attempted FBI fraud reports. Critical finding: performance degradation does NOT correlate with context saturation (r=0.167). Failures stem from state misinterpretation and emotional escalation, not memory limits. Paradoxically, 60k token memory windows performed WORSE than 30k. Tests 10 models including o3-mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0. Reveals systematic failure modes: misinterpreting delivery schedules, entering doom loops, abandoning working strategies. Human reliability may matter more than AI peak performance—consistent mediocrity beats brilliant-but-unpredictable.
